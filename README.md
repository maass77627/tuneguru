🎧 TuneGuru — Music Discovery & Collection App

TuneGuru is a React Single Page Application that helps music lovers discover, collect, and organize albums.
Users can browse music, add albums to their virtual collection, save favorites, and explore artists — all through a clean and interactive UI.

This version uses a json-server-template backend to quickly stand up a REST API during development.
